# CVNAdvanced
IRC bot for listening on Wikia CVN channels (`#cvn-wikia`, `#wikia-discussions`, `#wikia-spam`, `#cvn-wikia-uploads` and `#cvn-wikia-newusers` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net)) and transferring message information over multiple transports.

Documentation on how to use it is in `docs` directory.

Built with Node.js, webhooks, cubes, stars, bricks, duck-penguins, parrots, walruses, parrot-walruses, laundry machines and probably many more I can't remember at this time.

**CVNAdvanced has been deprecated.** Only currently supported functionality is the `#wikia-spam` transport, but that may change in the near future. If you have access to appropriate resources for it, use [KockaLogger](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/KockaLogger).
